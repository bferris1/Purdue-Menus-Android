It was created to address several issues with the official Purdue Mobile Menus app:
- The official app required identity, location, and phone permissions (and used the old permission system)
- The official app used GPS continuously, even after the app was closed, causing significant battery drain
- The design makes it inconvenient to compare menus between dining courts for a given day
