It was created to address several issues with the official Purdue Mobile Menus app:
- The official app required identity, location, and phone permissions (and used the old permission system)
- The official app used GPS continuously, even after the app was closed, causing significant battery drain
- The design makes it inconvenient to compare menus between dining courts for a given day

The current priorities for development are:
1. Adding support for the locations endpoint
    - [x] Implement retrieval of relevant location information
    - [x] Store Locations list and sorting preferences locally
    - [x] Use locations list to retrieve menus
    - [x] Possibly allow locations to be hidden
2. Improving the program structure (and testing)
    - [x] restructuring the app to fully utilize Android Dependency Injection with Dagger 2
    - [ ] writing tests for individual components
    - [ ] moving all view-related data to ViewModel
3. Improving the way data is retrieved
    - [ ] break UpdateMenusTask into components
    - [ ] improved thread management for background operations (Executors, etc) - make sure the latest retrieval task has priority over previously queued operations
    - [ ] deciding if data should be refreshed from network after a cache hit - currently it is always refreshed
    -  maybe use a library like [Store](https://github.com/NYTimes/Store) to help manage menu retrieval and caching. It uses RxJava, which could fit in well with the current implementation
    - or, use Kotlin coroutines together with architecture components to handle network operations and caching
    - [ ] improved exception handling for network/JSON parsing exceptions
4. Implementing the favorites system
    - [x] Login (store cookie) and retrieve favorites
    - [x] Store favorites locally in a suitable format (Room database)
    - [x] Add/remove favorites locally
    - [x] Synchronize favorites between local database and the menus API
5. Adding Favorite Item Notifications
    - [x] Periodically cache the next week's menus in the background
    - [ ] Send notifications when favorite items are served
        - [ ] Allow users to specify notification times
    - [ ] Create a Favorites Summary Activity to be launched from the notification
